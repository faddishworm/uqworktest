# uqworktest

Thanks for taking the time to view my worktest project. The purpose of this readme explains some of the thought process and justification behind the frameworks/technologies used. 

## Framework & Library Choices
To implement the backend I have used the Slim Framework http://www.slimframework.com/

Its a great microframework for quick restful api implementations, it can be quickly installed using PHP composer and handles routing fairly well out of the box.
